## Summary
### Summary

### Reccomendations 
The first reccomendation I'd make is conducting an analysis on the start and end locations at different times. This would provide the investors with valuable data on when specifically the best time for maintence of the bikes it. For example, if some parts of the city get more traffic during the day compared to other parts that may be trafficed more at night it may be valuable to include these visualizations. There are some parts of cities where people go out at night and some parts that are busier during the day due to commerical and business use. Investors would want to know this data to better plan the bikes around the city and to plan maintance.
