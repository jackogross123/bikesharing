## Results
This first image is a screenshot of my jupyer file since I was actually unable to attach the csv files to my repo. I was able to turn the tripduration column into a date format by navigating through the pandas documentation.

The second image depicts trips by hour. As it can be seen from the graph, most of the trips are less than an hour and the most popular times for having the bikes are for 5 minutes. This means that most of the trips are very short distances.

This image shows the same as the last one expect that it's by gender. As it can be seen from the graph - most people who rent bikes in NYC identify as male.

This heatmap shows the most popular times for bike renting. As it can be seen the hours of 6pm-7pm are very popular for renting bikes. This may be because people are riding bikes from work or after work.

This heatmap shows similar things as images 3 and 4. As it can be seen - men rent the most amount of bikes.

## Summary
### Summary
As it can be seen from the images. The most popular time to rent bikes are from 6pm-7pm. Men use bikes the most. Of the days of the weeks - wednesday's are normally the slowest for bike rentals.

### Reccomendations 
The first reccomendation I'd make is conducting an analysis on the start and end locations at different times. This would provide the investors with valuable data on when specifically the best time for maintence of the bikes it. For example, if some parts of the city get more traffic during the day compared to other parts that may be trafficed more at night it may be valuable to include these visualizations. There are some parts of cities where people go out at night and some parts that are busier during the day due to commerical and business use. Investors would want to know this data to better plan the bikes around the city and to plan maintance.

I'd also reccomend investigating how frequently bikes are stolen or broken. This would help investors plan a budget as to how much they will have to fix or replace.
